                                Hello! My name is Ryan Petrat, I am an undergraduate pursuing a BA in Computer Science at Boston University. As a fresh new 
                                mind eager to apply my abilities, I am eager for exciting and challenging opportunities to learn and grow personally and 
                                professionally. Where I currently lack in professional experience, I possess and have honed educational knowledge in required, 
                                practical and advanced skills to excel and succeed working as an individual contributor or with others in a workplace team 
                                environment. The engineering skills I possess are broad and effective to be a reliable contributor to a team looking for 
                                knowledge and practical experience in effective engineering and testing abilities, proven problem-solving skills 
                                conscientious about deploying error free solutions quickly with a keen ability to find and fix bugs when they occur. 
                                I'm told I am an enthusiastic person who listens well and considers all sides of an issue to build a consensus to achieve 
                                both short- and long-term objectives. All while I'm a happy and positive person with a relaxed demeanor and a strong 
                                willingness to help everyone whenever they ask or seem in need of assistance.
